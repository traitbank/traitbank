## Building TraitBank

To compile traitbank from their sources, please run the following on a ```*nix``` system with GNU Make, Bash, jq, mlr and preston available:

```
make
```

after getting this repository copied (e.g., using ```git clone```, or download a zip archive) onto a ```*nix``` system that has GNU Make and Bash available.

This should generate a ```dist``` folder with files like ```dist/traits.tsv``` in it. The recipe for creating TraitBank is stored in [```Makefile```](./Makefile)
